# Height Prediction from Age using Decision Tree
## Short Description
This repository contains a project that uses a decision tree to predict height based on age. The project includes a Python script, a Jupyter notebook, and a dataset to train the model.

## Features
* Height prediction using a decision tree algorithm
* Training data stored in a CSV file
* Model implementation in Python
* Accompanying Jupyter notebook for exploration and development

## Installation
To use this project, clone the repository and ensure you have Python installed on your system. Check repository files for details on required libraries and dependencies.

## Usage
1. Explore the `15_HeightPredictionFromAge_DECISIONTREE.ipynb` Jupyter notebook for data analysis and model development.
2. Run the `15_heightpredictionfromage_decisiontree.py` script to train and test the decision tree model.

## Example/Commands
Check the Python script and Jupyter notebook for specific commands and example usage.

## Folder Structure
The repository contains the following notable files and directories:
* `dataset.csv`: Training data for the model
* `15_heightpredictionfromage_decisiontree.py`: Python script for training and testing the model
* `15_HeightPredictionFromAge_DECISIONTREE.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data analysis and model development
* `.git/`: Git version control system files

## Dependencies
